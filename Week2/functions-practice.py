# Creating and Calling Functions

# Create a function called greetings that prints "Hello World!"
def greetings():
    print("Hello World")
# Call greetings and run this Python file
greetings()

# Create a function called add_num: 
def add_num():
# Inside your function define two variables: x and y, assign 5 to x and 7 to y
    x = 5
    y = 7
# print the sum of x and y
    print(x + y)
# Call your function
add_num()

# Create a function called subtract_num:
def subtract_num():
# Inside your function define two variables: x and y, assign 10 to x and 3 to y
    x = 10
    y = 3
# print the difference of x and y
    print(x - y)
    
# Call your function
subtract_num()

# Create a function called multiply_num:
def multiply_num():
# Inside your function define two variables: x and y, assign 5 to x and 7 to y
    x = 5
    y = 7
# print the product of x and y
    print(x * y)
# Call your function
multiply_num()

# Create a function called divide_num:
def divide_num():
# Inside your function define two variables: x and y, assign 10 to x and 2 to y
    x = 10
    y = 2
# print the quotient of x divided by y
    print(x / y)
# Call your function
divide_num()
